Day1 (04/30/2023)
	* Explaining basics of Git and Eclipse
	* Created git account
	* Created a maven project
	* pushed local project into online 
	* added collaborator
	* Importing a project from remote to local (Cloning)
	
Day 2 (05/01/2023)
	* Importing a project from remote to local (Cloning)
	* General things about Java
		* everything in Java is Object (but there is a but) 
		* Object has structure and it does a specific work
	 
Real time

Access Modifer
Personal things 
common things


each room is to do a specfic designated work. 
	each room is called Method.
	Method in java is to do a specific work
	Whatever work you do, it should be a method or inside a method
	Whatever happens inside a method is invisible to others
	You can take reception room water bottle to any methods room but you can not take methods room things to other places (there is a but)

Structure 
People - 50
chair - 100
table - 10

people, chair, table - data type 

People - 100 - chair 100 - data type and variable 
One person in that people name is Sathya - name 

Taluk office building 
	It is to do a set of work - marriage, income & other certificates
	Marriage certificate method, Income certificate method, etc. (each of them are methods)
	Class in java consist of many methods
	Taluk office - Class


People adminstration - package
Chennai Taluk office - Class 
	below are sub classes of Chennai Taluk office 
Velachery Taluk office - Class 
	Velachery east Taluk office - Class (He is sub class of Velachery class)
Tambaram Taluk office - Class
Guindy Taluk office - Class 

* Sub classes of Chennai are Velachery, Guindy and Tambaram
* Velachery east is sub class of Velachery 
* Velachery east is same package of Tambaram but not a sub class of Tambaram

Based on this only we created access modifier 


Police department adminstration - package
Chennai police station 
Tambaram police station 

Hospital administration - package 
chennai hospital (Govt and private) 
tambaram hospital 

Law management - package
Chennai court 
Tambaram court 

Chennai administration - project
	People adminstration - package
	Police department adminstration - package
	Hospital administration - package 
	Law management - package
	

* People adminstration have a set of rules
* Police department have set of rules
* Hopspital adminstration 
	private hospital rules set
	Govt hospital rules set 

These rules set in Java are called interface

Taluk office 
	Receptionist - Chennai Taluk office receptionist
	Reception Phone - Chennai taluk office phone 
	Reception table - Chennai taluk office reception table 
similarly for other classes too. 

They are always belongs to their specific class  - static 
	* Whenever we call a static member outside of class, we call them with their class name 
	* within a class, we call static member directly (no need to call as Chennai Taluk office Receptionist)

Velachery Govt hospital - class 
	* They are scheduling a health checkup camp 
		* In this case, they take doctors, nurses, medicines, operation room, cleaning room and other things from Velachery Govt hospital only

Health checkup camp - Object name 
Object we create for class only
When creating object, they take/create copy of all the things in that class

Tambaram police station wants health check up 
* In Tambaram police station's campus, we create object for Tambaram Govt hospital health check up camp 

Coming back to Taluk office 
clerk in taluk office, we take as constructor

* We just tell what you want 
* you tell what you want with document
* you tell what you want with document1, document2
* you tell what you want with documents, amount
* you tell what you want with amount

* Class - It does a set of work. It consist of variables and methods. Each work would be done by methods. 

* Methods - It does specific job. It always written inside a class

* Variable - it can have type(Data type) and posses a number or name;
			variables can have different access - access Modifier
			
* Access Modifier - difines where we can use a variable/method/class

* Interface - It contains rules most of the time. Sometimes it does some work too(means method).
			Interface is always followed by class/classes. 
			When class follows interface, class should do the rule written in the interface

* package - contains class/classes/interface/interfaces/file/files/folder/folders

* Project - consist of package/packages/file/files/folder/folders/source(src)folder

* static - static means belongs to the class. If govt hospital is class, then hospital receptionist is a static member of that class. 
We can not seperate them variables and methods can be static
			within a class - static can be used anywhere directly (in a static method or in non-static method)
			Outside calss - static can be used but alone with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)

* Object (instatiation or initiation)  - E.g: Medical camp; 
			We create Object only for classes; Whenever we create object we copy whatever the class contains(except static)
			means, only non-static is copied
			Through object we can not call static things.

* Constructor - Object creation happens with the help of constructor
				constructor is available in different kind
				1. without any money/permission
				2. only with money
				3. only with permission
				4. with both money and permission
				
**************************************************************************
DAY 3(02/05/2023)

Class - important thing, through which we perform some task. Class may contains methods and variables

Method1 - A work
Method2 - B work
Method3 - C work ( A work + some other work)

redundant - repeatable 
reuse

Variables - shape and count/name
shape - datatype 

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Datatype: Its a classification of a data, which tells the compiler or interpretor about how the programmer intends to use the data.

1) Primitive
	a) boolean - yes or no OR true or false 
	b) Textual 
		char - a, b, c, A, B
		byte - 
			byte x = 10;
	c) numeric 
		int 
		short
		double
		long
		float

2) Non Primitive
	d) String 
	e) array

each datatype has a default value

* default value of String is null
* default value of int is 0
* boolean - false

How we declare datatypes
Syntax = accessModifier dataType variableName = variableValue

int a = 10;  
int a;
String a = "10";
String a;
String a = null; (null is a keyword here, it means String a has nothing.)
String a = "null"; ("null" is a String/word here.)
double a = 10d;
char sathya = 'A';
boolean Boolean = true;

int a; - declare
a = 10; - define/initiate

int a = 10;
int - data type( primitive --> numeric)
a - variable/variableName;
10 - value posses by the variable/ value pointed by the variable


&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


Variables - Its a memory location that can hold values of a specific datatype.

Types of variables 
1. Local variable - 
	* declared within a method/constructor, for, if    -- block ({...})
	* scope of local variable is only within the block in which the variable is declared
	* intialisation of local variable is madatory
	* local variables can not be static
	{
	int a = 10;
	char c;
	String sathya = "10";
	}
	
2. Instance variable/class variable/non-static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block ({...})
	* Non- static variables
	* To access instance variables, we need to create object
	
	int a = 10;
	String sathya = "10";
	
	
3. static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block
	* static keyword is used with variables and methods
	* To access this variable, dont need to create an object
	* within a class - static can be used anywhere directly (in a static method or in non-static method)
	* Outside class - static can be used but along with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)
	
	static int a = 10;
	static String sathya = "10";
	
	ClassA (TalukOffice) {

static int a = 10;
//a = receptionist;

method1() {

print (a);


}

}


ClassB (Govt hospital) {

method2() {
print (ClassA.a);
//print (TalukOffice.receptionist)
}
	
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
	
Access Modifier
	* It defines where and who can use a method/variable/class
	1) default
	2) private
	3) protected
	4) public 
	
	Syntax = accessModifier dataType variableName/variable = variableValue
	int a = 10; - default (no need to mention "default" word
	private int a = 10;
	protected int a = 10;
	public int a = 10;
	
	
	packageA
		classA ( public int a = 10)
			ClassAA (same package and sub class of A)
		classB (same package but non sub class of A)
	packageX
		classX (diff package non sub class)
		classXA (diff package but sub class of A)
		
	

                                     | default |  private  | protected  | public 
									 |         |           |            |

									 |         |           |            |
same package but non sub class       | yes     | no        | yes        | yes
									 |         |           |            |
different package but sub class      | no      | no        | yes        | yes

JVM, JRE, JDK

our codes - english - .java
compile - .class - byte code (machine recognizable language)


JVM - Java Virtual Machine 
* This can not be seen
* it starts the execution(creates Runtime Environment)
* It first checks for main method
* It creates the code flow, in java the flow is called "Thread" 
* JVM provides run time environment in which Java byte codes can be executed
* loads code| verifies code| execute code| provides run time environment

JRE - Java Runtime Environment
* Physically exist
* Contains JVM and set of libraries
* JVM uses these libraries to execute the codes

JDK - Java Developement kit
* It contains JVM, set of libraries and dev tools (JRE + dev tools)
* Used to develop and execute the codes
* Dev tools + debugger + compiler + java doc

What is eclipse (IDE)

Its an editor to edit and view your project or project files
While writing itself, it will notify us about complilation errors

Its a user interface to view your project or file in an easy way

* Dependency Management tool
* we dont need to download any jar files(dependency).
* Group ID, Artifact ID and Version
* If we create a project with mavan as a dependency management tool, we get a proper project structure.
* Important file in maven project is pom.xml. In this file, we add dependency details 
* Dependencies will be stored in .m2 folder

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Git (one of the SCM - source code management tools)

We can store our project code in a proper structure. 
It will help us to reduce time and many people can work on a project at a same time 

1. Create a project in local (our system)
2. Create git account
3. Create a repo in your git account (remote)
4. We view our local project in system through Eclipse
5. We need to connect our Eclipse with Git repo

upload project in Git

Steps to upload project in Git hub

1) Create a remote repository
2) In your system open git bash from your project location
3) enter below commands
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "any message you can type here"
	git remote add origin SSHURL
	git push origin master
	
	
	To view status:  git status 
	to clear lines: clear

DAY 6(11/05/2023)

JAVA

* Java is case sensitive language
* Object Oriented Program(OOPs)
* But its not 100% OOPs language. Why? (we will see it later) 

JAVA Standard

Java keywords
new, class, access modifiers, static, this, super, throw, throws, try, catch, final, finally,
data types, if, for, while, break, continue, switch

Naming conversion in java
* Should not use above things
* homepage - homePage (Camel case)

If you are creating package, package name
* should start with small letter followed by camel case

if you are creating class
* should start with Captial letter followed by camel case

thisIsPackageName 
ThisIsClassName
ThisIsInterfaceName

thisIsMethodName
thisIsObjectName or ThisIsObjectName
thisIsVariableName



Syntax

class 

accessModifer class(Java keyword) className {

}

e.g: public class GovtHospital {

}


method 

accessModifer static/Non-static returnType methodName() {

}

static/Non-static accessModifer returnType methodName() {

}

public void thisIsNonStaticMethod() {

}

public static void thisIsStaticMethod() {

}

static public void thisIsStaticMethod() {

}

Methods in Java

1) static method
2) non static method

With in a class
* calling static method from a static method - directly call
* calling static method from a non static method - directly call 

* calling non-static from a static method - Object creation
* calling non-static from a non static - Object creation/ directly call

Outside class
	1. calling static method from non static method - using className
	2. calling static method from static method - using className
	3. calling non-static method from non-static method - Creating Object
	4. calling non-static method from static method - Creating Object
	
**********************************************************************
DAY 7(12/05/2023)

Object creation - to call non-static methods

	* Java is a Object Oriented Programming language.
	* But its not 100% OOPs language.
	* Almost everything in Java is based on Object only
	* Super most class of Java is Object class
	* Whatever class we create, it always follows Object class by default. 
	* Object class also, contains methods and variables 
	* Whenever we want to use non static variables/methods, we need to create object for the
		respective class.
	* We call it as Object intantiation or Object creation
	* We create object only for classes
	* Syntax for object creation
		ReferenceClassName ObjectVariableName = new ConstructorOfClassForWhichWewantToCreateObject();
		ClassA obj = new ClassA();
	* For a single class, we can create multiple objects (either within class or outside class)
	* DEFINITION
		* Whenever we create Object for a class, whatever non-static members present in that class
			will be copied and stored in heap memory

*************************************************************************	
DAY 8(13/05/2023)
			
What is heap memory? 

Memory Management

Heap memory
Stack memory
SCP (String Constant Pool - A part of heap memory)

We have seen
	Access modifier 
	Datatype/variables basic
	Methods 
	Object

ClassA obj1 = new ClassA();

ClassA - Class Name
Obj1 - Object Name variable
new = key word to create obj
ClassA() - Constructor or Object creation or instance creation

* Whenever we create an object for a class, whatever non-static variables and methods present in that class will be copied to heap memory
* Object varibale or instance variable, is stored in stack memory 
* We can create multiple object for a single class


	stack memory			Heap me
	obj1.				a = 10; method1();
	obj2				a = 10; method1();
	obj3				a = 10; method1(); 
	obj1ClassB			non static members
	
	
int a = 10;
* a = 10 - it will be stored in stack memory

String Literals
	String Sathya = "1000"; 
	
Object creation for String
	ClassA obj1 = new ClassA();
	String Sathya = new String("1000"); 

Sathya - Stack
1000 - SCP of Heap memory

String str = "Sathya";
String str1 = "Sathya";
String str2 = "Ranjith";

stack 		SCP
str			"Sathya" - 
str1 		
str2 		Ranjith

str1 = str1 + str2;
str1 = SathyaRanjith

str - Sathya - SathyaRanjith


stack 		SCP
str			"Sathya" - 
str1 		SathyaRanjith
str2 		Ranjith

str1 = str1+"abc"

			
String a = "new";
a = a+"10";
a = new10;

Immutable concept 
* It happens with String literals

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Data types as variables 
Variables in Java

Based on where we use our data types or variable names, we categories variables in 3 types 

1. Local variable
2. Class level or instance variable 
3. static variable

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Data type as a parameter and return type
Variable as a parameter

Methods in Java
1) method without return type
2) method with return type
3) static method
4) non static method
5) parameterized method
6) Non parameterized method

**************************************************

DAY 9(14/05/2023) - Class1

Return type in detail


&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


DAY 9(14/05/2023) - Class2

Methods starts with { and ends with }

Method with body or concrete method 
Ex: public void method1() {

}

Methods can be without body or bodyless method or abstract method
Ex: public void method1();



Interface in Java
	* Creating interface within interface
	* creating class within class
	
*****************************************************

DAY 10(15/05/2023)

* Interface examples -> WebDriver, WebElement, List
* Interface as a return type --> List<WebElement> findElements(By by))
* Class as a parameter  --> findElement(By by) ;

driver.findElement(By.id("text")).click();

WebElement.click();


driver.findElement(By.xpath("")).isSelected();

WebElement(Gender checkbox).isSelected();


driver.switchTo().window(); //TargetLocator.window();
driver.switchTo().alert();
driver.switchTo().frame();



driver.switchTo().alert().accept();


TargetLocator.alert().accept();

Alert.accept();

Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
alert.accept():


TargetLocator var = driver.switchTo();
Alert alert = var.alert();
alert.accept();

TargetLocator var = driver.switchTo();
Alert alert = var.alert();
String str = alert.getText();
syso(str); --> No benefits selected

driver.switchTo().alert().getText();


driver.switchTo().alert().accept();


public int method1() {

}

int variableName = obj.method1();



Abstract class in introduction

**************************************************

DAY 11(16/05/2023)

Abstract class  in detail


*&&&&&&&&&&&&

Whenever you study a new concept, in that concept include previously studied concepts

If you are studying abstract class, then in that concept, you need check how the below things works
Variables
methods (static or non static / parameterized or not / with or without return type)
Object 
Interface

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

OOPs concept

Object Oriented Program means everything in the program is considered as Object

Java is OOP language but not 100% OOPs language. Primitive date type (int, float, etc.), they are not object. 

Root class of Java is Object. Means, if you create any class, Object class is always extended. But it is implicitly used.

public class ClassA {

} 

this is nothing but 

public class ClassA extends Object {

}

OOPs Concepts in Java

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

*******************************************************************

DAY 11(17/05/2023)			
		
Inheritance concept in detail

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

What is Method signature

accessModifier static/non-static returnType methodName(with or without Parameter) {

}

methodName(with or without Parameter) - method signature 

##########################

OOPs - Polymorphism

One thing available in different format.

* depends on 
	1) inheritance
	2) object creation
	3) method signature (method name and parameters(with or without))


Two polymorphism - Overloading, overriding 

OverLoading 
* It happens within a class 
* Method name should be same and parameters should vary

Overriding
* It happens between two classes (Parent and child class) - Inheritance concept
* Method name should be same and parameter also should be same


********* main method learning *********

********************************************************************************

DAY 12(19/05/2023)

Topics we covered before
	* Variables
	* Methods
	* Static
	* return type

	* Override
	
Once we see the basic of Constructor, we are going to implement all the above topics on Constructor


**********************************************************************

Day 13 (21/05/2023) 

Use of Constructor 

* Short cuts for selecting word, sentence
* Navigating through a sentence


******************************************************************************

Day 14 (23/05/2023)

Keywords in Java

access modifiers
data types
class, interface, package, abstract
return types, return
extends, implements
new
if, for, while, do


final
static
super, super()
this, this()

static
 * always belongs to the class
 * object creation not needed
 * static members within a class - direct calling
 * static members outside a class - className.staticMemberName
 * we can overload static method
 * we can not override static method
 * In interface, we can create a methods with body but that method should be either static or default
 
 
Final
 * we have to initiate while declaring
 * Once value its initalized, we cant change the value at any point
 * we can use final with variables, methods and class
 
 Super and this keywords

super() and this() 

*****************************************************************************

Day 15 (26/05/2023)

Agile



Two kind of methodology
1. Agile
2. Water fall.

Difference between waterfall and agile 

Agile methodology

key words 

Scrum time period or Agile time period  (Iteration)
	- one or two week or 15 days (Mostly its starts on Wednesday and ends with Tuesday)
	
an epic serves to manage tasks. It's a defined body of work that is segmented into specific tasks 
(called “stories,” or “user stories”) based on the needs/requests of customers or end-users


PI meeting - 
	High level team works on who will work on which changes and those changes will be split into small parts so that, 
	we can do that small work in one sprint time
	Duration: 4 hours to half a day 
	Attendee: Product Owner and Scrum master
	
Sprint Planning
	Task(User Stories) for small work is created, explained, assigned to a person, complexity will be decided
	Here complexity is called story point
	Basically story point is fibanocci series 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
	
	Inform your leave plan
	 
Daily Stand-Up
	What you did yesterday
	what are you going to do today 
	what is your plan for tomorrow
	Any risk on completing work
	
	leave details for unplanned or planned leave
	
Sprint Review/Demo
	Give prove it or demo on whatever stories you did on that sprint

Sprint Retrospective
	What went well and appreciations
	What need improvement
	
	
When there is a risk in completing a story
	E.g: Developer gives story to testing when there is only 3 days left. But in order to complete the testing you need 7 days
In this case
	1. No other choice you need to complete the testing in 3 days itself.
	2. Complete as much as possible, then create a new QA(Testing) story in next sprint
	3. Move the entire story from this sprint to next sprint
	4. Let your scrum master to ask for extension of the current sprint

	* One Account can have multiple projects
Domain - Health & Welfare
Project - Bank of America
Project contains many teams and they are called scrum teams (POD)  

Consider client as your project team *****
Each POD is a scrum or agile team

	Product Owner(PO) - BIM or BOM
	Scrum master - Like lead but does only managerial work
	Devs(Onshore and offshore) - 
	Testers(Onshore and offshore)
	Business Tester if there is any
	
	In my team totally 12 members
	1. PO (client person)
	2. SM (from client or from our company)
	3. 2 dev in onsite (from client or from our company)
	4. 3 dev in offshore (from client or from our company)
